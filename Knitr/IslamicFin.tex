\section{Introduction}


\section{Shariah Law}
\begin{frame}{Shariah law}
The Islamic religion prohibits the payment of \emph{riba} and other activites
\begin{itemize}
\item Riba is usually translated as \emph{usuary} or \emph{excessive interest}
\item Usuary has been and remains an issue in western banking
\begin{itemize}
\item Interest loans banned in ancient Greece and Rome
\item Early Christian prohibition of usuary left market for lending to those aligned to judaism 
\item Names like \emph{Rothschilds} and \emph{Goldman Sachs} and \emph(Warburg)
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Sharing of risk}
The emphasis in Islamic finance is the \emph{sharing of risk} and having a real product underlying all financial transactions
\begin{itemize}
\item With interest payments, there is no risk and therefore money is making a return for itself
\item Islamic finance does encourage entrepreneurial activities
\item Islamic products are usually designed to share the risk
\item There is also prohibition of activites linked to alchol, prostitution, gambling and other prohibited actions
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Islamic Products}
\begin{frame}{Islamic banking}
The main Islamic banking products are
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Musharakah}:  A joint venture established by bank and borrower. Profits and losses are shared in fixed proportion.  Fixed payments are prohibited. 
\item \textbf{Ijara}: A rental agreement that will allow a someone to use an assets (house, car, machinary) for a fixed period and a fixed price
\item \textbf{Mudarabah}: A partnership where one party provides the money for an investment while the other provides the management and the labour
\item \textbf{Hibah}:  A gift given volentarily.  This is a proportion of the profits. Islamic banks pay customers a gift on savings. 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Capital market products}
The main Islamic product is the \emph{Sukuk}.  These are bonds that conform with Shariah law.  
\begin{itemize}
\item Sukuk represent part ownership of tangible.  Risk and gains are shared. 
\item Sukuk are administered through \emph{Special Purpose Vehicles} (SPV) by the issue of certificates
\item There are some disputes over the legal access to the assets of the SPV
\item There are some risks that Islamic scholars decalre securities that were \emph{halal}
\item There are futures and warrant markets in Malaysia
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

 
\section{Issues}
\begin{frame}{Issues}
Among the issues
\begin{itemize}
\item Islamic sukuk issuance costs are above those of conventional bonds (Asian Development Bank).  Profits on Sukuk in Malaysia are 8\% higher
\item Higher advisor fees because more complex
\item Sukuk bond are almost as cheap as conventional in Middle East
\item Efforts to make London a financial hub of Islamic finance: Islamic finance taskforce
\item Is Islamic finance more stable than conventional finance?  IMF says no.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
